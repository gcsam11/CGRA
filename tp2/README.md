## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1 we started by copying the figures form the last TP since they were the figures that made part of the tangram we were meant to build.
Then on the MyScene.js file we started testing the waters of the tranformation matrixes by placing the diamond in the correct position of the tangram.
        Achieving that, the rest was obtained following the same process with the necessary transformations. Making use of the functions pushMatrix, popMatrix, translate, scale, rotate and setDifuse we altered the position, scale, orientation, and color of the pieces in order to build the tangram.
        Once the resulting image was fully built the process was transfered over to the file myTangram.js where we worked on trying to center it with the scene.


- In exercise 2 we simply created a cube myUnitCube.js where we placed the tangram from the previous exercise.

- In exercise 3 we created a square myQuad.js which we then displayed 4 times and transformed making use of the previously mentioned tools in order to create a cube with 2d planes istead of a 3d object. Same process from the Tangram was used where we first created the cube directly on the myScene.js file and once finished transfered over to its own file.
