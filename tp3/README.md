## TP 3 Notes

- In exercise 1 we started by copying the Tangram and the UnitCube files from the previous TP.
We then manually, 1 by 1, repeated the vertices and created the normals for the objects.
Then we created the 'Madeira' type material with 0.3 specular component and tested on the Cube:

We then did the normals for the Tangram, simply by repeating vertices and doing a normal upwards and another downwards on the y axis. After that we applied the Custom Material to the Tangram and took a screenshot of the MyDiamond sub-piece (we played around with the custom values)
